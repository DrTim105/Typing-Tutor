A GUI virtual keyboard 

(Typing Tutor: Tuning a Crucial Skill in the Computer Age) 
Typing quickly and correctly is an essential skill for working effectively with computers and the Internet. 
In this exercise, you’ll build a GUI application that can help users learn to “touch type” 
(i.e., type correctly without looking at the keyboard). 
The application should display a virtual keyboard and
should allow the user to watch what he or she is typing on the screen without looking at the actual keyboard.
Use JButtons to represent the keys. 
As the user presses each key, the application highlights the corresponding JButton on the GUI and 
adds the character to a JTextArea that shows what the user has typed so far. 
You can test your program by typing a pangram—a phrase that contains every letter of the
alphabet at least once—such as “The quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog.” You can find other
pangrams on the web.
